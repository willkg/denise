Summary
=======

Denise is Dennis-as-a-Service.

.. Note::

   This is a copy-and-paste hacked-together monstrosity that
   does what I wanted it to do.

   It's a prototype.

   It's pre-alpha.

   Its future is unknown. I may never work on this again.


Install and configure
=====================

1. Create a virtual environment.

2. Install the dependencies::

       $ pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Read through the settings in ``denise.py``

   TODO: Document settings that need to be set here.

    $ python manage.py runserver
